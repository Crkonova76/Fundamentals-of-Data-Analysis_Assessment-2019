### Definitions:

#### Standard deviation

In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range

#### Corelation and Covariance

“Covariance” indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables. “Correlation” on the other hand measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is a function of the covariance. What sets them apart is the fact that correlation values are standardized whereas, covariance values are not. 


#### Regression analysis

Regression analysis is a statistical method that allows to examine the relationship between two or more varaibles of interest. While there are many types of regression analysis, at their core they all examine the influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable.
