# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis_Assessment-2019

Name: Martina Crkonova
Instructions: The assesment concerns the Tips dataset and the Python packages seaborn and jupyter.

### About the dataset

Food servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United States) are a major component of pay. In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all cus- tomers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s work schedule.

The analysis is divided into 3 sections:
* Descriptive analysis of the dataset
* Regression analysis 
* Detailed analysis of selected variable


### Definitions:

#### Standard deviation

*source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range

#### Corelation and Covariance

“Covariance” indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables. “Correlation” on the other hand measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is a function of the covariance. What sets them apart is the fact that correlation values are standardized whereas, covariance values are not. 


#### Regression analysis

Regression analysis is a statistical method that allows to examine the relationship between two or more varaibles of interest. While there are many types of regression analysis, at their core they all examine the influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable.
